# what-makes-people-happy-R
Identify clusters concerning demographics and retrieve what makes each group happy with HappyDB.

This analysis in R is based on the open dataset HappyDB (https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/). 
It includes the data of 10843 people and 100535 happy moments, which were collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

The analysis in R is basically divided into the following steps:  

1.a Data Exploration & Text Analysis of the Happy Moment Dataset (credits to: Chen Chen https://www.kaggle.com/powderist/happydb-analysis , who did the Text Analysis in Python)  
1.b Data Exploration & Clustering of the Demographic Dataset  
2. Correspondence Analysis on the Joined Dataset  
3. Classificatin using an Conditional Inference Tree  
4. Assessment of the results & future work  

Any improvements are highly welcome!
Most importantly, have fun! :)
